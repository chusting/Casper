#Casper# (the friendly ghost) is a free, open, fork of the original simple blogging platform [Ghost](https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost) that's available to anyone who wants to use it. Lovingly created and maintained by [John O'Nolan](http://twitter.com/JohnONolan) + [Hannah Wolfe](http://twitter.com/ErisDS) + an amazing group of [contributors](https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/contributors).

#Casper# aims to extend the simplicity of [Ghost](https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost) by utilizing a few extra components, i.e.; Primary Images for individual posts, filterable tags, blog categories & navigation to name a few.

##Interested in joing in on the development?## We need (and would love) the help of the othe others in the Open Source community.
